# Ivee for PostgreSQL and AI

## pgvector

In the rapidly evolving world of AI, the ability to efficiently store, manage, and query vector embeddings has become paramount.
[pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension steps in to address this need, seamlessly extending the capabilities of PostgreSQL
to handle these high-dimensional mathematical representations that underpin many modern AI applications.

From powering semantic search engines that understand the meaning behind queries to enabling recommendation systems that anticipate user preferences,
`pgvector`'s applications span a wide spectrum.

With Ivee for PostgreSQL you can easily enable `pgvector` extension and unlock a new level of AI-driven functionality within your database.

* Connect to your database:

    ```bash
    psql -U your_username -h ivee_pg_host -p ivee_pg_port
    ```

    You define the username at the cluster creation time. The host and the port can be obtained from *Connectivity* tab in [Ivee portal](https://app.ivee.cloud).

* Enable pgvector extension:

    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION vector;
    ```

Your database is ready for vector data.

## Verify and test

You can quickly validate if pgvector works as expected by running the following commands:

* Create a simple table

    ```
    CREATE TABLE items (
        id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        embedding vector(3)
    );
    ```

* Insert some sample embeddings:

    ```
    INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES
        ('[1.2, 3.4, 5.6]'),
        ('[0.1, 0.9, 2.3]'),
        ('[4.5, 6.7, 8.9]');
    ```

* Find the nearest neighbor to a query embedding:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM items
    ORDER BY embedding <-> '[1.0, 3.0, 6.0]'
    LIMIT 1;
    ```
    This query uses the `<->` operator to calculate the Euclidean distance between vectors.

* Clean up - drop the table:

    ```
    DROP TABLE items;
    ```
