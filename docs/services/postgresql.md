# Ivee for PostgreSQL

## The advanced open source relational database

PostgreSQL is a powerful, highly extensible open source object-relational database system known for its robustness,
data integrity, and rich feature set. Ivee provides a fully managed PostgreSQL experience,
powered by [Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL](https://www.percona.com/postgresql/software/postgresql-distribution),
allowing you to focus on innovation, not database administration.

## Supported versions

Ivee currently supports the following PostgreSQL versions:

* 14
* 15
* 16
* 17

## PostgreSQL for AI

Leverage the power of `pgvector` to build and deploy Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications
directly within your PostgreSQL database. Ivee makes it easy to [integrate AI capabilities](postgresql-for-ai.md) into your data-driven projects.

## PostgreSQL for timeseries

Harness the capabilities of TimescaleDB, a powerful time-series extension for PostgreSQL,
to efficiently store, query, and analyze time-series data. Ivee simplifies the management of
TimescaleDB, enabling you to focus on extracting insights from your time-series workloads.
